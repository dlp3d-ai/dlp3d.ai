## Overview
Digital Life Project 2 (DLP2) is an open-source real-time framework that brings Large Language Models (LLMs) to life through expressive 3D avatars. Users converse naturally by voice, while characters respond on demand with unified audio, whole-body animation, and physics simulation directly in the browser. Characters are fully customizable in both appearance (3D models) and personality (character prompts) and readily adaptable to any LLM or text-to-speech (TTS) service.
